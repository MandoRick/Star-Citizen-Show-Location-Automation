This is a Processing Java script that will send the key command /showlocation in the game Star Citizen.
The /showlocation command shows your coordinates in the Start Citizen chat box, and Star Citizen coppies your location to your clipboard.
The program listens to your clipboard and then displays the new content every time it updates, which should be your coordinates.
There is a slider to set the delays between sending the key command and a Start/Stop button.
